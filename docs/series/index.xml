      <title>drop series</title>

      <guid>https://docs.siridb.net/series/drop_series/</guid>
      <description>Syntax:
drop series [series_match] [where ...] [set ignore_threshold true/false]  Drops series from SiriDB. Optionally you can use a match and/or where statement to filter the series you want to drop. For more information about how to match series look at list series.
SiriDB has a mechanism to protect you from accidentally dropping all (or many) series. This is done with a threshold value. If the server receiving your drop request finds more series to drop than the threshold, the request is denied and you receive an error_msg about trying to delete more series than the threshold value.</description>
