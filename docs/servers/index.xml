      <description>Syntax:
alter server &amp;lt;server_uuid / server_name&amp;gt; set &amp;lt;option&amp;gt;  Valid options are address, port, backup_mode and log_level. We can use both, a servers name or uuid to change a server. To view the current servers names and uuids use the command: list servers name, uuid
set address/port Usually its not required to change the servers address or port using this command but instead you should change the address/port in the configuration file (default /etc/siridb/siridb.</description>

      <description>Syntax:
count servers [received_points/selected_points] [where ...]  Count servers returns the number of servers in a SiriDB cluster. Received points are the number of points received by a server since uptime. After a restart the received points counters are reset to zero.
 Info
Received points only shows the number of points after uptime. For the total number of points you can use count series length
 Examples:
# Get number of servers count servers # Get number of servers in pool 0 count servers where pool == 0 # Get total received points since uptime count servers received_points # Get total number of selected (queried) points since uptime count servers selected_points  Example output (count servers):</description>

      <title>drop server</title>
      <link>https://docs.siridb.net/servers/drop_server/</link>

      <guid>https://docs.siridb.net/servers/drop_server/</guid>
      <description>Syntax:
drop server &amp;lt;server_uuid / server_name&amp;gt;  Can be used to remove a server. We only allow dropping a server which has a replica since scaling down in number of pools is currently not supported. A server needs to be turned off before it can be dropped.
 Note
When having two servers in a pool, let&amp;rsquo;s call them siri1 and siri2 and for some reason siri2 is broken and does not start.</description>
