# Connect

There are several options to communicate with SiriDB. By default each server listens to port 9000 for client connections.

SiriDB currently has connectors available for Python, Go, R, C/C++, PHP, Java and Node.js.

As an alternative to the connectors, SiriDB has support for HTTP requests through an HTTP API.
